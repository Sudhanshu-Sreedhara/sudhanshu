        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm Sudhanshu Sreedhara Belavarthy, a Computer Science student specialized in AIML at CHRIST University. I have a passion for technology, sports, and creative arts like playing the flute, basketball, and painting.</p>

        <p>I have always been fascinated by how technology can change the world, especially in fields like Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Over the years, I have honed my skills in programming, problem-solving, and working on real-world projects. I am constantly looking for new challenges that push me to learn and grow in the field of technology.</p>

        <p>Besides my academic interests, I am also passionate about sports and the arts. Playing the flute and basketball are not just hobbies but activities that help me balance my life and stay energized. I also enjoy painting, which gives me an opportunity to express my creativity in a different way. I'm always looking to learn new things and improve myself both personally and professionally.</p>
